## Deep Zoom Image Demo using Solid JS

![Preview](240px-Image_pyramid.svg.png)

Create my own `Deep Zoom Image` using `Tile Pyramid` that was develop by Microsoft for Silverlight in 2008.

Today the Javascript version is [Open Seadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) and already widely used.

I challange my self to create my own for my personal project using `solid-js` with `vite-js`.
